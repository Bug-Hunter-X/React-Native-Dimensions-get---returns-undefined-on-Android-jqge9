This error occurs when using the `Dimensions` API in React Native to get screen dimensions, especially on Android.  The issue is that `Dimensions.get('window')` or `Dimensions.get('screen')` might return `undefined` initially, before the layout is fully rendered. This leads to errors when trying to use these values immediately. For example, you might get an error like `undefined is not an object (evaluating 'Dimensions.get('window').width')`.
